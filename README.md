# antimalarial_resistance_DRC

This repository holds all data and plotting scripts needed to reproduce plots from the paper "The Impact of Antimalarial Resistance on the Genetic Structure of Plasmodium falciparum in the DRC", by Verity, Aydemir and Brazeau et. al. This includes plots in the main text and in the supplemental material. In cases where the plotting data and scripts are located elsewhere, the relevant links are contained within the figure folder.
