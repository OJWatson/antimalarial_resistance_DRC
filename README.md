# antimalarial_resistance_DRC

This repository holds all data and plotting scripts needed to reproduce plots from the paper "The Impact of Antimalarial Resistance on the Genetic Structure of Plasmodium falciparum in the DRC", by Verity, Aydemir and Brazeau et. al. This includes both plots in the main text, and in the supplemental material.
